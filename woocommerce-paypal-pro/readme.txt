Easily add PayPal Pro and PayPal Checkout payment gateways to WooCommerce. Accept credit cards on-site or offer the latest PayPal payment buttons.

== Description ==

This plugin adds two PayPal payment gateway options to your WooCommerce store:

**PayPal Pro (On-Site Credit Card Checkout)**

Accept credit card payments directly on your checkout page. Your customers enter their card details on your site and never leave to complete the transaction. The credit card checkout experience is seamless and smooth.

The following video shows the credit card checkout experience:

**PayPal Checkout (Latest PayPal Payment Buttons)**

Offer the latest PayPal payment buttons on your checkout and cart pages. Your customers can pay using their PayPal account, credit/debit card, Venmo, Pay Later, and other payment methods supported by PayPal. The plugin uses PayPal's Commerce Platform (PPCP) to provide a modern and secure checkout experience.

You can enable one or both payment gateways depending on your needs.

**Features**

* Two payment gateways in one plugin: PayPal Pro and PayPal Checkout.
* On-site credit card checkout via PayPal Pro.
* Latest PayPal payment buttons via PayPal Checkout (PayPal, Credit/Debit Card, Venmo, Pay Later).
* Easy one-click account connection for PayPal Checkout using the automated onboarding flow.
* PayPal buttons on both the checkout page and the cart page.
* Compatible with the WooCommerce block-based checkout page.
* Compatible with the legacy shortcode-based checkout page.
* Compatible with WooCommerce High-Performance Order Storage (HPOS).
* Full sandbox (test) mode support for both gateways.

**Configuration**
